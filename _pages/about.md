<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), affiliated with the Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Data Science (STSDS) research group led by Prof. Genton. I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2023. During my doctoral studies, I undertook research visits to Hong Kong Baptist University and KAUST. I received my BS degree in Statistics from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, 2018. 

My research interests include large-scale spatio-temporal statistics, subsampling, and non-parametric regression.
